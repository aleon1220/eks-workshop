module RBAC
Entity
A group, user, or service account (an identity representing an application that wants to execute certain operations (actions) and requires permissions to do so).

Resource
A pod, service, or secret that the entity wants to access using the certain operations.

Role
Used to define rules for the actions the entity can take on various resources.

Role binding
This attaches (binds) a role to an entity, stating that the set of rules define the actions permitted by the attached entity on the specified resources.

There are two types of Roles (Role, ClusterRole) and the respective bindings (RoleBinding, ClusterRoleBinding). These differentiate between authorization in a namespace or cluster-wide.

Namespace

Namespaces are an excellent way of creating security boundaries, they also provide a unique scope for object names as the ‘namespace’ name implies. They are intended to be used in multi-tenant environments to create virtual kubernetes clusters on the same physical cluster.

we’ll create an IAM user, map that user to a kubernetes role, then perform kubernetes actions under that user’s context.

### Get all resources in a namespace

`kubectl get all -n rbac-test`

### switch users

To make it easy to switch back and forth between the admin user you created the cluster with, and this new rbac-user, run the following command to create a script that when sourced, sets the active user to be rbac-user:

```
cat << EoF > rbacuser_creds.sh
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(jq -r .AccessKey.SecretAccessKey /tmp/create_output.json)
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(jq -r .AccessKey.AccessKeyId /tmp/create_output.json)
EoF
```

## MAP AN IAM USER TO K8S

kubectl get configmap -n kube-system aws-auth -o yaml > aws-auth.yaml

### Append the new user mapping user-> AWS IAM user

```
cat << EoF >> aws-auth.yaml
data:
  mapUsers: |
    - userarn: arn:aws:iam::${ACCOUNT_ID}:user/rbac-user
      username: rbac-user
EoF
```

- we’ll need to define a role, and then bind the user to that role. We’ll do that next.

## CREATE THE ROLE AND BINDING

```
unset AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
unset AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

```

- create a role called pod-reader that provides list, get, and watch access for pods and deployments, but only for the rbac-test namespace. Run the following to create this role

```
cat << EoF > rbacuser-role.yaml
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: rbac-test
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["list","get","watch"]
- apiGroups: ["extensions","apps"]
  resources: ["deployments"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
EoF
```

### We have the user, we have the role, and now we’re bind them together with a RoleBinding resource. Run the following to create this RoleBinding

```
cat << EoF > rbacuser-role-binding.yaml
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: rbac-test
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: rbac-user
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
EoF


# APPLY
kubectl apply -f rbacuser-role.yaml
kubectl apply -f rbacuser-role-binding.yaml
```

## VERIFY THE ROLE AND BINDING

```
. rbacuser_creds.sh; aws sts get-caller-identity

kubectl get pods -n rbac-test

kubectl get pods -n kube-system
Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "rbac-user" cannot list resource "pods" in API group "" in the namespace "kube-system"
```
